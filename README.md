SVM Classify Images Of Cats And Dogs
# Cat and Dog Image Classification using SVM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The classification is achieved using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is a supervised learning model commonly used for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled images of cats and dogs. It is assumed that the dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with a sufficient number of examples for both categories to ensure the model can learn effectively.

### Structure of the Dataset
- **Training Set**: Contains images used for training the model.
- **Testing Set**: Contains images used to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Requirements
### Libraries and Tools
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional for image preprocessing)

### Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
```

## Steps Involved
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Resize and normalize images to ensure uniformity.
- Convert images to grayscale if necessary.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Extract relevant features from images using techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or raw pixel values.

### 3. Model Training
- Train the SVM model using the training dataset.
- Use a kernel (e.g., linear, RBF) that best fits the data distribution.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Display a confusion matrix to analyze performance.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Tune hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter (C) and the kernel type for improved performance.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`cat-and-dog-image-classification-using-svm.ipynb`).
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Adjust hyperparameters or try different feature extraction methods to optimize results.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated on the test set. Key performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix are displayed. These metrics provide insight into the model's ability to correctly classify images of cats and dogs.

## Future Work
- Explore deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for improved accuracy.
- Use data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.
- Experiment with different feature extraction methods and kernels for the SVM.
